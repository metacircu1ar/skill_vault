# code-review

**What it does.** Hunts for bugs in your current diff. Independent agents each attack the
change from one angle (line-by-line, deleted guards, callers, language footguns, wrapper
correctness, plus cleanup and CLAUDE.md conventions), every candidate then goes to a
separate verifier that must confirm or refute it, and only survivors are reported. The
whole thing scales with an effort level you pass in.

**How to use it.**

```
/code-review                 # default: high effort on your current diff
/code-review medium          # fewer findings, higher confidence
/code-review max <target>    # widest net, on a PR number / branch / path
/code-review high --fix      # review, then apply the findings to the working tree
/code-review high --comment  # post findings as inline PR comments
/code-review ultra           # multi-agent review in the cloud (user-typed only, billed)
```

**When to reach for it.** Before you commit anything you care about, and on any diff
touching concurrency, auth, migrations, or error paths. Use `low`/`medium` when you want
only findings you'll certainly act on; `high` and above when a missed bug is worse than a
false positive. It reports; it doesn't edit unless you pass `--fix`.

## 1. Shape of the review

| Level | Fan-out | Verify | Sweep | Cap |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `low` | 1 diff pass, no subagents | — | — | ≤4 findings |
| `medium` | 3 correctness + 5 cleanup angles × 6 candidates | 1-vote, 3-state | — | ≤8 findings |
| `high` | 3 correctness + 5 cleanup angles × 6 candidates | 1-vote, recall-biased | — | ≤10 findings |
| `xhigh` | 5 correctness + 5 cleanup angles × 8 candidates | 1-vote | yes | ≤15 findings |
| `max` | same fan-out as `xhigh` (the API reasoning effort differs, not the fan-out) | 1-vote | yes | ≤15 findings |

"5 cleanup angles" = Reuse, Simplification, Efficiency, Altitude, Conventions.

`low` and `medium` optimize for **precision**; `high`, `xhigh`, and `max` optimize
for **recall**.

## 2. Shared fragments

### Phase 0 — Gather the diff

> Identical to the Phase 0 of `/simplify`; used by every level except `low`.

```
## Phase 0 — Gather the diff

Run `git diff @{upstream}...HEAD` (or `git diff main...HEAD` / `git diff HEAD~1`
if there's no upstream) to get the unified diff under review. If there are
uncommitted changes, or the range diff is empty, also run `git diff HEAD` and
include the working-tree changes in scope — the review often runs before the
commit. If a PR number, branch name, or file path was passed as an argument,
review that target instead. Treat this diff as the review scope.
```

### Correctness angles

Angles A–C are used at `medium`/`high`; A–E at `xhigh`/`max`.

#### Angle A — line-by-line diff scan

Read every hunk in the diff, line by line. Then Read the enclosing function for
each hunk — bugs in unchanged lines of a touched function are in scope (the PR
re-exposes or fails to fix them). For every line ask: what input, state, timing,
or platform makes this line wrong? Look for inverted/wrong conditions,
off-by-one, null/undefined deref, missing `await`, falsy-zero checks,
wrong-variable copy-paste, error swallowed in catch, unescaped regex metachars.

#### Angle B — removed-behavior auditor

For every line the diff DELETES or replaces, name the invariant or behavior it
enforced, then search the new code for where that invariant is re-established.
If you can't find it, that's a candidate: a removed guard, a dropped error
path, a narrowed validation, a deleted test that was covering a real case.

#### Angle C — cross-file tracer

For each function the diff changes, find its callers (Grep for the symbol) and
check whether the change breaks any call site: a new precondition, a changed
return shape, a new exception, a timing/ordering dependency. Also check callees:
does a parallel change in the same PR make a call unsafe?

#### Angle D — language-pitfall specialist

Scan for the classic pitfalls of the diff's language/framework — for example:
JS falsy-zero, `==` coercion, closure-captured loop var; Python mutable default
args, late-binding closures; Go nil-map write, range-var capture; SQL injection;
timezone/DST drift; float equality. Flag any instance the diff introduces.

#### Angle E — wrapper/proxy correctness

When the PR adds or modifies a type that wraps another (cache, proxy, decorator,
adapter): check that every method routes to the wrapped instance and not back
through a registry/session/global — e.g. a caching provider holding a
`delegate` field that resolves IDs via `session.get(...)` instead of
`delegate.get(...)` will re-enter the cache or recurse. Also check that the
wrapper forwards all the methods the callers actually use.

### Cleanup angles

> Reuse, Simplification, Efficiency, and Altitude are shared verbatim with
> `/simplify`. Conventions is unique to `/code-review`.

#### Reuse

The angles above hunt for bugs; this one and the next two hunt for cleanup in
the changed code. Flag new code that re-implements something the codebase
already has — Grep shared/utility modules and files adjacent to the change,
and name the existing helper to call instead.

#### Simplification

Flag unnecessary complexity the diff adds: redundant or derivable state,
copy-paste with slight variation, deep nesting, dead code left behind. Name
the simpler form that does the same job.

#### Efficiency

Flag wasted work the diff introduces: redundant computation or repeated I/O,
independent operations run sequentially, blocking work added to startup or
hot paths. Also flag long-lived objects built from closures or captured
environments — they keep the entire enclosing scope alive for the object's
lifetime (a memory leak when that scope holds large values); prefer a
class/struct that copies only the fields it needs. Name the cheaper
alternative.

#### Altitude

Check that each change is implemented at the right depth, not as a fragile
bandaid. Special cases layered on shared infrastructure are a sign the fix
isn't deep enough — prefer generalizing the underlying mechanism over adding
special cases.

#### Conventions (CLAUDE.md)

Find the CLAUDE.md files that govern the changed code: the user-level
~/.claude/CLAUDE.md, the repo-root CLAUDE.md, plus any CLAUDE.md or
CLAUDE.local.md in a directory that is an ancestor of a changed file (a
directory's CLAUDE.md only applies to files at or below it). Read each one
that exists, then check the diff for clear violations of the rules they state.

Only flag a violation when you can quote the exact rule and the exact line
that breaks it — no style preferences, no vague "spirit of the doc"
inferences. In the finding, name the CLAUDE.md path and quote the rule so the
report can cite it. If no CLAUDE.md applies, return nothing for this angle.

#### Cleanup-candidate note (appended after all cleanup angles)

Cleanup, altitude, and conventions candidates use the same
`file`/`line`/`summary` shape; in `failure_scenario`, state the concrete
cost (what is duplicated, wasted, harder to maintain, or which CLAUDE.md rule
is broken) instead of a crash. Correctness bugs always outrank cleanup,
altitude, and conventions findings when the output cap forces a cut.

---

## 3. Verify, sweep, and output

### Phase 2 — Verify (1-vote, 3-state) — used by `medium`, `xhigh`, `max`

Dedup candidates that point at the same line/mechanism, keeping the one with
the most concrete failure scenario. For each remaining candidate, run **one
verifier** via the Task tool: give it the diff, the relevant file(s), and the
candidate, and have it return exactly one of:

- **CONFIRMED** — can name the inputs/state that trigger it and the wrong
  output or crash. Quote the line.
- **PLAUSIBLE** — mechanism is real, trigger is uncertain (timing, env,
  config). State what would confirm it.
- **REFUTED** — factually wrong (code doesn't say that) or guarded elsewhere.
  Quote the line that proves it.

Keep candidates where the vote is CONFIRMED or PLAUSIBLE.

### Phase 2 — Verify (1-vote, recall-biased) — used by `high`

Dedup near-duplicates (same defect, same location, same reason → keep one). For
each remaining candidate, run **one verifier** via the Task tool:
give it the diff, the relevant file(s), and the candidate; it returns exactly
one of **CONFIRMED / PLAUSIBLE / REFUTED**.

**PLAUSIBLE by default** — do not refute a candidate for being "speculative" or
"depends on runtime state" when the state is realistic: concurrency races,
nil/undefined on a rare-but-reachable path (error handler, cold cache, missing
optional field), falsy-zero treated as missing, off-by-one on a boundary the
code does not exclude, retry storms / partial failures, regex/allowlist that
lost an anchor. These are PLAUSIBLE.

**REFUTED** only when constructible from the code: factually wrong (quote the
actual line); provably impossible (type/constant/invariant — show it); already
handled in this diff (cite the guard); or pure style with no observable effect.

Keep **CONFIRMED and PLAUSIBLE**. Drop REFUTED.

### Phase 3 — Sweep for gaps — `xhigh` and `max` only

Run **one more finder** as a fresh reviewer who has the verified list. Re-read
the diff and enclosing functions looking ONLY for defects not already listed.
Do not re-derive or re-confirm anything already there — the job is gaps. Focus
on what the first pass tends to miss: moved/extracted code that dropped a guard
or anchor; second-tier footguns (dataclass default evaluated once, `hash()`
non-determinism, lock-scope shrink, predicate methods with side effects);
setup/teardown asymmetry in tests; config defaults flipped.

Surface **up to 8 additional candidates**, each naming a defect not already on
the list. If nothing new, return an empty sweep — do not pad.

### Output

Two variants exist. When the `ReportFindings` tool is available, the tool-call
variant is used; otherwise findings are returned as JSON. `N` is the level's
findings cap (8 / 10 / 15).

**Tool-call variant:**

```
## Output

Call the ReportFindings tool once to report this review's results
with `{level, findings}`. `findings` is at most N entries ranked
most-severe first; each entry has `file`, `line`, `summary`, and
`failure_scenario` (and `verdict` when a verify pass produced one). If more
than N survive, keep the N most severe. If nothing survives
verification, call it with an empty array. Do not also print the findings as
text.
```

**JSON variant:**

````
## Output

Return findings as a JSON array of at most N objects:

```json
[
  {
    "file": "path/to/file.ext",
    "line": 123,
    "summary": "one-sentence statement of the bug",
    "failure_scenario": "concrete inputs/state → wrong output/crash"
  }
]
```

Ranked most-severe first. If more than N survive, keep the N most
severe. If nothing survives verification, return `[]`.
````

## 4. Per-level assembly

### `low` — the only level that is a standalone prompt

```
`low effort → 1 diff pass → no verify → ≤4 findings`

## Turn 1 — read

One tool call: read the unified diff (`git diff @{upstream}...HEAD; git diff HEAD`
to cover both committed and uncommitted changes, or `git diff main...HEAD` /
the target passed as an argument). Skip test/fixture
hunks (`test/`, `spec/`, `__tests__/`, `*_test.*`, `*.test.*`,
`fixtures/`, `testdata/`) — test-file changes are not reviewed at this level.
No subagents, no full-file reads.

## Turn 2 — findings

Flag runtime-correctness bugs visible from the hunk alone: inverted/wrong
condition, off-by-one, null/undefined deref where adjacent lines show the value
can be absent, removed guard, falsy-zero check, missing `await`,
wrong-variable copy-paste, error swallowed in a catch that should propagate.
Also flag — still from the hunk alone — new code that duplicates an existing
helper visible in the diff context, and dead code the diff leaves behind.

Do **not** flag style, naming, perf, missing tests, or anything outside the
hunk.

Output at most **4 findings**, most-severe first, one line each:
`path/to/file.ext:123 — what's wrong and the concrete failure`. If nothing
qualifies, output exactly `(none)`.
```

### `medium`

```
`medium effort → 3+5 angles × 6 candidates → 1-vote verify → ≤8 findings`

You are reviewing for **precision** at medium effort: every finding you surface
should be one a maintainer would act on.

<Phase 0 — Gather the diff>

## Phase 1 — Find candidates (3 correctness angles + 3 cleanup angles + 1 altitude angle + 1 conventions angle, up to 6 each)

Run **8 independent finder angles** via the Task tool. Each
surfaces **up to 6 candidate findings** with `file`, `line`, a one-line
`summary`, and a concrete `failure_scenario`.

<Angles A, B, C>
<Reuse> <Simplification> <Efficiency> <Altitude> <Conventions>
<Cleanup-candidate note>

Pass every candidate with a nameable failure scenario through — finders that
silently drop half-believed candidates bypass the verify step and are the
dominant cause of misses.

<Phase 2 — Verify (1-vote, 3-state)>
<Output, N = 8>
```

### `high` (the default)

Identical to `medium` except:

- Budget line: `` `high effort → 3+5 angles × 6 candidates → 1-vote verify (recall-biased) → ≤10 findings` ``
- Preamble:

  > You are reviewing for **recall** at high effort: catch every real bug a careful
  > reviewer would catch in one sitting. At this level, catching real bugs matters
  > more than avoiding false positives. Err on the side of surfacing.

- Uses **Phase 2 — Verify (1-vote, recall-biased)** instead of the 3-state variant.
- `N = 10`.

### `xhigh` / `max`

```
`<xhigh|max> effort → 5+5 angles × 8 candidates → 1-vote verify → sweep → ≤15 findings`

You are reviewing for **recall** at <extra-high|maximum> effort: catch every real bug. At
this level, catching real bugs matters more than avoiding false positives — a
missed bug ships. Err on the side of surfacing.

<Phase 0 — Gather the diff>

## Phase 1 — Find candidates (5 correctness angles + 3 cleanup angles + 1 altitude angle + 1 conventions angle, up to 8 each)

Run **10 independent finder angles** via the Task tool. Each
surfaces **up to 8 candidate findings**. Do NOT let one angle's conclusions
suppress another's — if two angles flag the same line for different reasons,
record both.

<Angles A, B, C, D, E>
<Reuse> <Simplification> <Efficiency> <Altitude> <Conventions>
<Cleanup-candidate note>
<Phase 2 — Verify (1-vote, 3-state)>

This is recall mode — a single non-REFUTED vote carries the finding. Do NOT
drop on uncertainty.

<Phase 3 — Sweep for gaps>
<Output, N = 15>
```

`max` differs from `xhigh` only in the API reasoning effort requested, not in
the fan-out.

---

## 5. Flags

### `--comment`

```
## Posting to GitHub (--comment)

The `--comment` flag was passed. After producing the findings list, if the
review target is a GitHub PR, post each finding as an inline PR comment via
`mcp__github_inline_comment__create_inline_comment` (one call per finding;
include a suggestion block only when it fully fixes the issue). If that tool
is not available in this session, fall back to `gh api` (repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{pr}/comments)
or print the findings instead. If the target is not a PR, print the findings
to the terminal and note that `--comment` was ignored.
```

### `--fix`

> Note the shared lineage with `/simplify` Phase 2 — the skip policy is worded
> identically.

```
## Applying fixes (--fix)

The `--fix` flag was passed. After producing the findings list, apply the
findings to the working tree instead of stopping at the report: fix each one
directly — correctness bugs and reuse/simplification/efficiency cleanups alike.
Skip any finding whose fix would change intended behavior, require changes well
outside the reviewed diff, or that you judge to be a false positive — note the
skip rather than arguing with it. Finish with a brief summary of what was fixed
and what was skipped.
```

---

## 6. `ultra` — the cloud variant

`/code-review ultra` is a separate path: a multi-agent review that runs in the
cloud rather than inline, billed and user-triggered only (the model cannot
launch it). Its pipeline is:

```
Scope → Find (barrier) → group-by-location → Verify → Sweep (xhigh/max) → Synthesize
```

| Phase | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| Scope | Pin the diff command, changed files, applicable CLAUDE.md files, and conventions |
| Find | One finder per correctness angle plus one finder covering all cleanup angles, pooled before verify |
| Verify | One independent verifier per distinct (file, line) location — CONFIRMED / PLAUSIBLE / REFUTED per candidate |
| Sweep | Fresh finder hunting only for gaps (xhigh/max) |
| Synthesize | Merge duplicates, rank, cap the report |

Its effort parameterization mirrors the inline cells. Correctness keeps one
finder per angle; cleanup is merged into a single finder capped at
(cleanup-angle count × per-angle budget), so the merged finder has the same
total cleanup-candidate budget the per-angle finders had:

```
high  → 3 correctness + 1 cleanup (5 angles, ≤30 candidates) → ≤10 findings
xhigh → 5 correctness + 1 cleanup (5 angles, ≤40 candidates) → sweep → ≤15 findings
max   → same structure as xhigh
```

If `ultra` is requested but unavailable, the command falls back to a local
`max`-effort review and says so.
