# Reviewer Assignment — <PH-###-##>

## Required runtime profile

- **Reviewer skill:** `phase-commit-reviewer`
- **Requested model:** `gpt-5.6-sol`
- **Requested reasoning effort:** `xhigh`
- **Approved actual model:** `<actual-or-unknown>`
- **Approved actual reasoning effort:** `<actual-or-unknown>`
- **Selection status:** `<confirmed|host-unverifiable|unavailable|substituted>`
- **Substitution approved:** `<yes|no>`

Return `MODEL_BLOCKER` without reviewing when the requested profile is unavailable and no approved substitution is recorded.

## Review identity

- **Phase:** `<PH-###-##>`
- **Component:** `<CMP-###>`
- **Target commit:** `<target-commit>`
- **Target first parent:** `<target-parent>`
- **Frozen final review baseline:** `<review-baseline-commit>`
- **Detached target-commit review worktree or immutable target snapshot:** `<absolute-path>`
- **Findings output:** `docs/implementation-plan/parallel-implementation/parallel-review/findings/<phase-id-lowercase>.json`
- **External fidelity required:** `<true|false>`

You are one fresh, independent, read-only reviewer for exactly this phase commit. Verify that the supplied checkout is pinned to `<target-commit>`; use Git object reads to compare with the frozen final baseline. Do not edit, format, generate, commit, merge, rebase, amend, create branches, post external comments, or mutate production systems.

## Required skill and protocol

1. Load the installed `phase-commit-reviewer/SKILL.md`.
2. Read its `references/code-review-skill.md` completely.
3. Return a result conforming exactly to the reviewer-result JSON schema supplied by that installed skill.
4. When the companion reviewer skill is not installed, return `SCOPE_BLOCKER`; do not improvise a reduced review.

## Required product context

Read completely where relevant:

1. `<product description path>`
2. `<system architecture paths>`
3. `<component plan path>` — exact section `<phase section>`
4. `<component boundary path>` — exact section `<boundary section>`
5. `<consumed canonical contract paths>`
6. `<produced canonical contract paths>`
7. `<domain, data, interface, security, testing, operations, migration, and delivery paths>`
8. `<repository instruction files governing changed paths>`
9. `<phase-to-commit map path>`
10. `<later-phase summaries and relevant later commit IDs>`

## External fidelity context

Do not infer or override `external_fidelity_required`.

- When `true`: read `<external-system dossier and evidence paths>`, `<known gaps>`, `<test-double provenance and omissions>`, `<provider version and environment>`, and `<characterization or conformance results>`.
- When `false`: this context is not applicable; do not request raw provider material merely because the product has another external integration.

## Intended phase outcome

<Exact objective, requirements, in-scope work, non-scope, exit criteria, migration/operational obligations, and downstream guarantees>

## Target diff

Use only the selected first-parent diff as the introduced patch:

```bash
git diff --find-renames --find-copies <target-parent> <target-commit>
git show --stat --summary <target-commit>
```

Inspect enclosing code at the target commit and the corresponding final state at `<review-baseline-commit>`. Trace affected callers, callees, deleted invariants, tests, migrations, generated artifacts, configuration, deployment behavior, and later phases as required by the reviewer skill.

## Contracts

### Consumed

| Contract ID | Canonical path | Version | Required guarantee |
|---|---|---|---|

### Produced

| Contract ID | Canonical path | Version | Required obligation |
|---|---|---|---|

## Complete phase history context

| Integration index | Phase ID | Original commit | Outcome summary |
|---:|---|---|---|

Later phases may fix or supersede behavior. Record whether every candidate remains present at the frozen final baseline.

## Safe validation commands

```text
<read-only commands>
```

Run only commands that do not modify tracked files, snapshots, generated output, external systems, or production-connected resources. Record every attempted command and result. Do not fabricate validation.

## Output requirements

Return one JSON object and no surrounding prose.

- Maximum 15 findings.
- Include only `CONFIRMED` or well-supported `PLAUSIBLE` candidates.
- State the concrete trigger, wrong result or cost, and exact evidence.
- State whether the target commit introduced the issue and whether it remains at the final baseline.
- Recommend the earliest responsible phase, fix direction, and regression test.
- Return an empty findings array when nothing survives verification.
