# Code Review Loop Formal Verification

This directory contains the TLA+ state machine and reproducible TLC checks for the review protocol coordinated through one fixed shared directory.

## Files

- `CodeReviewLoop.tla` — state machine, safety invariants, fairness assumptions, and liveness properties.
- `CodeReviewLoop.cfg` — normal TLC configuration with one bounded lock loss enabled.
- `CodeReviewLoopEarlyUnlock.cfg` — negative mutation that unlocks before feedback publication.
- `CodeReviewLoopTempFileEarlyUnlock.cfg` — negative mutation that unlocks after the reviewer temp write but before rename.
- `CodeReviewLoopEarlyCompletionPublication.cfg` — negative mutation that publishes completion before cleanup finishes.
- `run-tlc.sh` — digest-verifying TLC runner.
- `check-state-space.sh` — guards the recorded state counts and graph depth.
- `check-early-unlock.sh`, `check-temp-file-unlock.sh`, and `check-cleanup-order.sh` — ensure deliberately invalid transitions violate their intended properties.

## Abstraction and file mapping

The model treats the captured coordination directory as one abstract file namespace and keeps clean identifiers independent of the skill's `.skill_vault_` filesystem prefix:

| Model field | Skill file |
| --- | --- |
| `files.reviewLock` | empty review-lock marker |
| `files.implementorToReviewerTmp` | implementor-to-reviewer temp channel |
| `files.implementorToReviewerTxt` | implementor-to-reviewer final channel |
| `files.reviewerToImplementorTmp` | reviewer-to-implementor temp channel |
| `files.reviewerToImplementorTxt` | reviewer-to-implementor final channel |
| `files.roundComplete` | empty completion marker |

The six file-presence fields are initialized independently, so TLC explores all 64 possible stale startup combinations. The implementor removes them one at a time, with completion removed last. The reviewer begins in `offline`; `StartReviewer` represents the external caller launching it only after startup cleanup completes. Reviewer-local participation is encoded by `pollingFresh` versus `pollingParticipated`, while the `request` record contains only per-request bookkeeping.

Top-level state is factored into six canonical variables: the two actor states plus `files`, `content`, `request`, and `faults` records. Every action specifies the full next state of every top-level variable.

The implementation and both channel bodies are abstracted to Boolean version bits. A finite `feedbackKind` records findings or the exact `NO_FINDINGS` sentinel. Concrete message text, the coordination-directory path, repository and context paths, path-equality validation, and filesystem calls are otherwise abstracted away. The lock and completion marker are presence-only signals and carry no data.

## Modeled behavior

The model covers:

- cleanup from every possible combination of six stale startup files, with stale completion removed last;
- externally ordered reviewer launch after startup cleanup;
- mandatory implementor context on every request, with an initial publication and later reuse or atomic refresh;
- atomic publication for both directional channels;
- opposite channel polarity: implementor publication while unlocked and reviewer publication while locked;
- implementation and implementor-message freezing through a missing-lock retry gap;
- one bounded lock deletion before reviewer acquisition or while a reviewer is active but undecided;
- findings-or-`NO_FINDINGS` publication before every reviewer unlock;
- implementor read/handling followed by a separate inbound-message acknowledgement;
- another planned implementation phase after `NO_FINDINGS` without terminating the reviewer;
- exactly one reviewer-channel decision per logical request;
- implementor-owned final cleanup and completion publication only after `NO_FINDINGS`;
- completion acknowledgement by the participating reviewer and implementor observation of that acknowledgement;
- successful termination with all six files absent.

The action relation assumes both agents follow the protocol. TLC checks compliant interleavings and explicitly enabled mutations; it does not establish that an LLM will obey the skill, limit protocol polling to the captured directory, or keep review activity static and read-only.

## Run

Java 11 or newer and a `tla2tools.jar` build are required:

```sh
./run-tlc.sh
./check-state-space.sh
./check-early-unlock.sh
./check-temp-file-unlock.sh
./check-cleanup-order.sh
```

The normal run must finish without errors. The state-space check reruns it and fails if the recorded counts or depth change. The final three commands enable deliberately invalid actions and succeed only when TLC reports the intended property violation.

Override tool discovery when needed:

```sh
JAVA_BIN=/path/to/java \
TLA2TOOLS_JAR=/path/to/tla2tools.jar \
TLA2TOOLS_SHA256=expected-digest \
./run-tlc.sh
```

The runner verifies the pinned default jar's SHA-256 digest. A custom jar is verified when `TLA2TOOLS_SHA256` is supplied; otherwise the runner warns. `TLC_METADIR` selects the state directory, and `TLC_COVERAGE=1` enables action coverage.

The recorded 2026-08-26 normal run completed without errors after generating 1,399 states, finding 930 distinct states, and reaching graph depth 22. TLC checked eleven temporal-property branches. All three negative mutation checks produced their expected violations.

Coverage confirms both lock-loss locations and retry: `LosePollingLock`, `LoseActiveReviewLock`, and `RetryMissingRequest` are reachable. Both reviewer outcomes and both implementor choices after them are reachable, as are `PublishCompletion`, `AcknowledgeCompletion`, and `ObserveCompletionAcknowledged`. `RemoveCleanupReviewerTmp` and `RemoveCleanupImplementorTmp` remain at `0:0` because compliant publication ordering makes both temp files absent before final cleanup; they remain defensive actions matching the skill's remove-if-present instructions. Arbitrary stale temp cleanup is exercised during startup.

## Fault-model limits

The simplified protocol intentionally delegates lifecycle isolation to external orchestration. The model assumes the implementor completes startup cleanup before the reviewer is launched and that no reviewer from an older loop remains active. Because the files carry no IDs or generation tags, a stale live agent could otherwise interfere with a new loop; that behavior is outside the model rather than silently claimed as verified.

Filesystem checks and subsequent writes or removals are separate real calls but single TLA+ actions. The model therefore does not prove compare-and-act atomicity. It does exercise one bounded lock deletion while the reviewer is polling, reviewing, or publishing, and proves that retry preserves the same frozen logical request. Repeated deletions and arbitrary lock loss after a decision are not modeled.

After startup, temp files are reachable only while their compliant publisher is active. Fairness lets `AbortReviewAfterLockLoss` clear a reviewer temp before retry. TLC verifies that the implementor context file exists and remains frozen; it abstracts the required absolute paths, task source or full text, evidence explanation, and implementor notes rather than interpreting their prose. It also abstracts the review itself, so it does not prove that the reviewer avoids builds, tests, execution, or writes outside the protocol files, nor that it prioritizes substantive correctness over compilation concerns. TLC is untimed and does not model the skill's three-poll timeouts for a stuck temp or an unexpected completion marker, an owner crash leaving a permanently orphaned temp, arbitrary findings text, or whether an LLM understands and correctly acts on a message it read.

The model assumes the participating reviewer remains live long enough to remove the completion marker. The skill bounds the implementor's wait to three polls and otherwise leaves the marker as a durable pending-shutdown signal; that timeout branch is outside the model.

The fault budget permits one environmental lock deletion before a reviewer decision. Early unlocks and early completion publication are enabled only by their negative configurations.

## Verified tool identity

The local verification used OpenJDK 25.0.2 and an untagged TLA+ master build whose manifest reports `Implementation-Version: 2.0 2026-08-11`, an empty `X-Git-Tag`, and revision [`0894c3407f4717fec7cc18bde3bf3c857fa47333`](https://github.com/tlaplus/tlaplus/commit/0894c3407f4717fec7cc18bde3bf3c857fa47333), with TLC banner `2026.08.11.125311`. Its SHA-256 digest is `ab323b79802aedc3203b3f9af37c6aca3ed43f4e0225b36f2aa77b26de46c05f`, which `run-tlc.sh` verifies before launching the pinned default binary.

This binary came from the mutable Clarke `v1.8.0` pre-release channel; `v1.8.0` is not its implementation version and the channel asset is not a durable content pin. Reproduce the run with the exact digest above or build the referenced source revision.
